I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, aiding the [Extending New Narratives](https://www.newnarrativesinphilosophy.net/index.html) project.

My primary research interests are 17th and 18th century philosophy and metaphysics.

I received my PhD from the University of Toronto in 2021.

I am from [Pécs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pécs).

*You can find my email and CV under my photo, and read about my research and teaching through the menu.*
